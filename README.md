# AM Modulation Python Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the principles of Amplitude Modulation (AM) using Python. The goal is to simulate the process of AM modulation, allowing users to understand how information can be transmitted over a carrier wave by varying its amplitude.
My Question also include to print the power and maximum and minimum modulated voltages. 

## Features
- Generate a carrier wave.
- Modulate the carrier wave with an input message signal.
- Visualize the carrier, message, and modulated signals.
- Print the Carrier Power , Side Band Power , Total Power along with the Maximum and Minimum Modulated Voltages.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
